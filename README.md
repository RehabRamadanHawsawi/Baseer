Database created using Roboflow
Recognize text from images with OCR, detect objects with YOLO, and then collect data to train and label them.

--OCR model training: TensorFlow's machine learning library was used to train the OCR model on the labeFled dataset. Make the model able to recognize handwritten text and extract it from images.

--Train the YOLO Model: Use the machine learning library (Roboflow) on the labeled dataset to train the YOLO model. Make the model able to detect medicine boxes in the images.

--and all trained first in Google Colab, then using command lines to convert model files appropriate for each platform
